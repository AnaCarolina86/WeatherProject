# WeatherProject


It is a web application that provides the weather conditions in a city. The user chooses a city, then the website responds
with information about the weather, temperature and a description.

## Technical environment

I built this project using Node.js, Express.js, EJS and an API that provides the weather conditions. There are JavaScript, 
CSS, HTML, of course.
I chose the colors and a free illustration.
