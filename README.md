# WeatherProject


It is a web application that provides the weather conditions in a specific city. The user chooses a city, then the website responds
with information about the weather, temperature and a short description.

## Technical Environment

I built this project using:
* JavaScript/HTML/CSS, Bootstrap
* [API](https://openweathermap.org/api), a REST API
* Node.js, Express.js, EJS template 



I chose the colors and a free illustration from [unDraw](https://undraw.co/illustrations).
I am working on user experience improvements.
